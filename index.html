                <h1 class="hi">Hi.</h1>
                <h1 class="about">
                    I'm Bas. Im currently a first years student at the Rotterdam University of Applied science.
                </h1>  
                <h1 class="about">
                    In this quarter I followed the elective course of HTML and CSS, which I learned a lot.
                </h1>
                <h1 class="about">
                    At first, I had no idea what I was doing. But as I grew by trying, I did better and better.
                </h1>
                <h1 class="about">
                    What I learned the most is the basic stuff; how to put up a HTML site and where to use CSS for. 
                </h1>
                <h1 class="about">
                    On the other hand, I now know what some HTML tags are and where to use them for.
                </h1>
                <h1 class="about">
                    This allows me to setup my own site, to my own wishes, as you can see right now. 
                </h1>
                <h1 class="about">
                    As I found out, I'm more of a basic guy. I want things to be clean and easy to read. 
                </h1>
                <h1 class="about">
                    This is the reason why I made my site look like this.
                </h1>
            </section>
                <section class="action">
                    <h1 class="about">As I can say, I'm a beginner to writing HTML and CSS.
                    </h1>
                    <h1 class="about">After I finish this elective course, I will be writing HTML and CSS in my free time.
                    </h1>
                    <h1 class="about">This, because I really want to learn more about the other tags we never used. 
                    </h1>
                    <h1 class="about">Also, with HTML and CSS I can do much more then I learned in this couple of weeks. 
                    </h1>
                    <h1 class="about">With the things I learned, I will never become an advanced HTML and CSS writer.
                    </h1>
                    <h1 class="about">This is the reason why I will probably spend more time to become an advanced writer.

                    </h1>
                    <h1 class="future2">Also, it's good to know something about HTML and CSS; this will work in my advantage when searching for a job.
